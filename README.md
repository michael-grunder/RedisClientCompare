## RedisClientCompare

This is a throwaway project to make sure PhpRedis 6.3.0RC1 doesn't exhibit andy changed behavior. It simply generates command sequences at random and then can run them against different versions of PhpRedis and compare the results.

This project is not likely useful for anything else. :)
